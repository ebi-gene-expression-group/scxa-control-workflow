Experiment Description	We used scRNA-seq data generated using Smart-seq2 to reconstruct the native TCR from Ag-specific T cells and then to link these with the gene expression profile of individual cells. antigen specific CD8 T cells were obtained from a subject who had previously cleared hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. A cell line was also generated from the same subject and included in the analysis with and without antigen stimulation.

Protocol Description	Single cell RNA sequencing was performed using Smart-seq2 as described by Picelli et al. (Picelli et al. Nature methods 2013) with the following modifications. Cell lysis buffer was prepared by adding 1 lRNase inhibitor (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to 19 lTriton X-100 solution (0.2% v/v). Cells were sorted directly into tube containing 2 ul lysis buffer, 1 ul dNTP mix (10mM) and 1 ul oligo-dT primer at 5 M. Tubes were stored at -80 C until needed. Reverse-transcription and PCR amplification were performed as described with the exception of reducing the IS PCR primer to a 50 nM final concentration and increasing the number of cycles to 28. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT Library Preparation Kit (Illumina; San Diego, CA, USA) and sequencing was performed on Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq sequencing platforms.	PBMC were separated from freshly collected whole blood by density gradient centrifugation, before 4  10^5 cells per well were cultured in medium (AIM-V with 1% Glutamax, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated human AB serum (Sigma, USA) in 96-well U-bottomed plates in presence of 10 g ml 1 of the CINGVCWTV peptide (aa 10731081 of HCV non-structural 3 protein). For the initial culture, the cytokines, IL-7 (10 ng ml 1, Miltenyi Biotec), IL-12 (300 g ml 1, Miltenyi Biotec) and IL-15 (10 ng ml 1, Miltenyi Biotec) were added. Fresh AIM-V media and IL-2 (20 U ml 1, Miltenyi Biotec) was added to the wells on days 4 and 7 post-stimulation. On day 10 post-stimulation, cells were re-stimulated with irradiated autologous monocytes supplemented with IL-2, IL-7, IL-12 and IL-15 in same concentrations as stated for day 1. On day 14 and 17 fresh AIM-V media containing IL-2 (U ml 1) was added to the wells. The established cell line was harvested at day 20 and cryopreserved in RPMI with 20% DMSO. Re-stimulation of the cell line was performed with 10 g ml 1 of the CINGVCWTV peptide per well (2 x 10^5 cells in each well) for 24 h. Single cells were isolated from cell lines by flow cytometry	NextSeq	HCV-specific CD8+ T cells were stained with NS31073-Dextramer (Immudex; Copenhagen, Denmark). Live/Dead fixable blue dye (Invitrogen) was used to exclude non-viable cells from the analysis. Subsequently, cells were washed and surface stained with the following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs): CD3-APC- Cy7, CD8-Alexa Fluor700 and CD19-PE-Cy5 (BD Biosciences). After the final  wash the cells were resuspended in 500 l of PBS, 2mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) solution kept in dark at 4 C until data acquisition. After exclusion of non-viable/CD19+ cells, CD3+ CD8+ dextramer+ cells were sorted directly into 96-well PCR plates (Eppendorf) using a BD Influx cell sorter (BD Influx; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and stored at 80 oC for subsequent TCR analysis.
